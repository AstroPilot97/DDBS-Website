					<figcaption class = "sideCaption"><h1>MC</h1><br>
													In many ways, your typical high school student. <br>
													Prior to joining the Literature Club, he was pretty lonely <br>
													and shut in - indulging in video games and anime. <br> 
													Imbued with a snarky, dry sense of humour, our MC <br>
													may be a little dense and naive, but his heart's <br>
													always in the right place. 
				  </figcaption>
				  <figcaption class = "sideCaption"><h1>MoMC</h1><br>
													A caring, loving figure, filled to the brim with the insight <br>
													and wisdom only a mother can possess. It's good to know <br>
													that amidst all of the drama and stresses of teenage life, <br>
													family will always be there for you. Should you listen to <br>
													her advice, or has the time away from home made her<br>
													too distant from her son?
				  </figcaption>	
					<img src="graphics/Monika.png" style="width:25%"> 
					<img src="graphics/Emi.png" style="width:25%">
					<figcaption class = "sideCaption"><h1>Monika</h1><br>
													The level headed leader of the club. It was Monika's love <br>
													for literature that created the Literature Club <br>
													as we know it. In many ways she's the model student	- <br> 
													intelligent, attractive and athletic. Alongside her presidential <br>
													duties,	she's also a keen tennis player, an aspiring pianist, <br>
													amongst many other things. With aspirations that high and <br>
													this much responsibility,	life must be awfully stressful for her...
				  </figcaption>
				  <figcaption class = "sideCaption"><h1>Emi</h1><br>
													Transfer student and our 100% original <br>
													and undateable character. <br>
													Also part of the school's track team, <br>
													so you know she's gonna be bouncing with energy. <br>
													Yet she still finds ways to be late <br>
													to class... but hey, listen to her relationship advice, <br>
													'cause it'll really give you a leg up.

				  </figcaption> 
					<img src="graphics/sak.png" style="width:25%"> 
					<img src="graphics/shiori.png" style="width:25%"> 
					<figcaption class = "sideCaption"><h1>Akechi Sakurai</h1><br>
													 The MC's homeroom teacher, and in many ways, also a mentor. <br>
													 Possessing a fervent enthusiasm for the subject he teaches, <br>
													 Sakurai makes learning about history enjoyable - well, as <br>
													 enjoyable as it can be. His youth and sense of humour helps<br>
													 his students really relate to him - which's good, because <br>
													 the teenage years aren't easy, and MC needs as much help <br>
													 as he can get! He's also tall, handsome and so dreamy... <br>
													 Erm. S-so all the girls tell me.
				  </figcaption>
				  <figcaption class = "sideCaption"><h1>Shiori</h1><br>
													The MC's class rep <br>
													and one of Monika's close friends, <br>
													she's bluntly honest <br> 
													but a very loyal friend. <br>
													Although she has an alternative style, <br>
													that doesn't subtract from <br>
													how diligent she can be <br>
													in her school duties.
				  </figcaption>
					<img src="graphics/bullycunt.png" style="width:25%"> 
				</figure>
				<figcaption id = "bullyCaption"><h1>PeePeePooPoo</h1><br>
													Huge dicksmunch, likes cookies with raisins and zit-popping <br>
													in the shower. Chews loudly and is an overall asshole, <br>
													I bet he listens to Evanescence.
